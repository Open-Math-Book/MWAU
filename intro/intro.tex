\section{Mathematical Outcome}

The mathematical process is deeper than arriving at the correct answer. The goal of this chapter is to introduce the students and the instructor to the format of the text. The authors' hope is that the activities provided throughout the text will foster an interactive and cooperative classroom environment. This chapter is a set of logic problems which require little or no prerequisite knowledge and establish a foundation of thinking which will be used in activities throughout the text. 

You will find that the students will begin developing the basic problem solving skills throughout this chapters activities. They will encounter such questioning as; ``Is this the optimal answer?'' ``Can we show there is not a better way?''  ``Can we explain why our technique will solve the problem?'' etc. In answering these questions students are engaged in the mathematical method of developing reasoning through concrete examples.

To further this extension from the concrete to the abstract we begin asking students to change the variable of the problem to see if the previous solution technique continues to apply. In some cases a technique can be developed which will work for all possible arrangements of which it is natural to ask ``how do we know the method will work for all possibilities?'' However, the students are also exposed to solution methods which are not valid when a variable is changed. The contrast in the problems will hopefully develop the necessary curiosity which initiates the investigation process.

As a framework for the entire course, Polya's four step method for problem solving should be introduced, emphasized, and reemphasized throughout. Reference to these steps will be made from time to time within the instructor's notes, but they should be kept in the forefront of students' minds whether the prompts are there or not.

Polya's Problem Solving Method
\begin{enumerate}
\item Understand the problem (This may include reading the question several times, asking "what if" questions, tinkering with parts of the question, and so on.)
\item Devise a plan (Though this is often a completely separate step from understanding the problem, the tinkering used to understand may lead to an idea for a plan of action.)
\item Carry out the plan (When the plan can be completed, great! However, one may find they are unable to complete their plan of action due to its difficulty or faultiness. It is at this point, the method becomes iterative. The problem solver will need to revisit understand the problem or devising a plan to refine their approach.)
\item Review (Even when the plan can be carried out successfully, a review of the result is needed. Do the results answer the question asked? What evidence is there that the results are correct? Is that answer actually correct? If not, here is another place where the method becomes iterative. The problem solver will have to revisit one of the first three steps depending on the flaw identified.)
\end{enumerate}
It is important to emphasize that a natural part of problem solving is temporary failure. Noticing that there is a flaw in the solution to a problem (during the review) is a critical step in solving difficult problems. It should not be expected that anyone will devise correct, complete answers on their first try, and that this should not be considered failure. It is a temporary setback that should launch the problem solver down a new path. One only fails when one gives up trying new ideas.

\section{Activity: Making \$20}

\begin{center}How many different ways can you have \$20 in US bills?
\end{center}

\noindent Sometimes a simple question can have many layers, so we first must unpack and organize our thoughts before answering! We will use Polya's 4-step problem solving method to guide the process.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Understand the problem.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Can you write down three different ways to make \$20 in US bills? If yes, write them down---this is good progress toward understanding the problem! If no, a discussion with your peers is in order (What are "US bills"? What is meant by "make \$20"? etc.)
        \wbvfill
        \item What makes your three ways different?
        \wbvfill
        \item Are there other ways to make \$20? How many? (It's ok to make a wild guess at this point!)
        \wbvfill
        \item \label{billsto20} What denominations of bills are possible to use in a collection that sums to \$20?
        \par\Instr{ We begin with this simple question to make sure students are working with the same items before working toward a solution method.}
        \wbvfill
        \item Do you think you are being asked for an exact number for the total, or is an estimate good enough?
        \par\Instr{ This is a good time to steer students toward understanding that we are looking for an exact answer, not an approximation.}
    \end{enumerate}

\wbvfill
\item \textbf{Devise a plan.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{20witha1} Provide an example of a collection of bills that sums to \$20 that contains exactly one \$1 bill?
        \par\Instr{ There are many possibilities for such a collection of bills but each would need to contain at least two \$2 bills. This is meant to spark the students to think about the need for the \$2 bill if they missed it above and get them thinking about how they are going to organize their collections. If they have not thought about the \$2 bill, they would say it is impossible with a reasoning about how all other denominations being a multiple of $5$ but $20-1 = 19$ is not a multiple of $5$. Maybe they will list several solutions. If so, you might ask if they have them all and how they know.}
        \wbvfill
        \item \label{20witha1andno5} Is it possible to have a collection of bills that sums to \$20 that contains exactly one \$1 bill and no \$5 bills? If so provided an example or explain why none exists?
        \par\Instr{ This is impossible because using exactly one \$1 bill leaves us with \$19 remaining dollars but the only remaining bills (\$2, \$10, \$20) have even denominations so will never total $19$. A deeper look into this concept could produce the idea that any collection totaling \$20 must contain an even number of odd denomination bills. This question can spawn some deep thought into the ideas of parity and generating sets, but that is deeper than we expect students to take this topic. We will ultimately not use this approach, but it is a good example of the brainstorming process and the fact that some ideas will ultimately not be pursued.}
        \wbvfill
        \wbnewpage
        \item \label{making5} \textbf{One of the best ways to start problem solving is to solve a simpler similar problem.} One way to do that is to work on a lower total. List all the ways that U.S. bills can make a total of $5$ dollars. HINT: There are more than two ways.
        \par\Instr{ There are four ways. Besides illustrating the "solve a simpler problem first" technique, the purpose of this question is to start the students thinking of how they will list out a collection of bills and to help the student realize they have three denominations of bills to work with---many times students will forget about the \$2 bill!}
        \wbvfill
        \item \label{making10} Let's continue our exploration of simpler problems. Write down all the collections of bills that make \$10.
        \par\Instr{ This is meant to make sure the students are all on the right track before answering the larger question. It will also be useful in answering a later question. We suggest you stop the class at some point and have a group present their solution and \textbf{have a class discussion on tree diagrams}. The 11 solutions are written out in bill denominations below.\\
            (1) 10\\
            (2) 5-5\\
            (3) 5-2-2-1\\
            (4) 5-2-1-1-1\\
            (5) 5-1-1-1-1-1\\
            (6) 2-2-2-2-2\\
            (7) 2-2-2-2-1-1\\
            (8) 2-2-2-1-1-1-1\\
            (9) 2-2-1-1-1-1-1-1\\
            (10) 2-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1\\
            (11) 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1
        }
        \wbvfill
        \wbvfill
        \item Did you use the result from \ref{making5} in solving \ref{making10}? If no, what is one way you could have? HINT: See if you can find a connection between your answer to part \ref{making5} and your answer to part \ref{making10}.
        \par\Instr{ 4 of the collections that make \$10 start with a \$5 bill. That there are 4 is no accident. Starting with a \$5 bill means the remaining bills must sum to \$5, and there are 4 ways to do this as seen in the solution of part \ref{making5}. In other words, the solution to part \ref{making10} could have been written as\\
            (1) \$10\\
            (2,3,4,5) \$5 (with 4 ways to make the remaining \$5 as seen in \ref{making5})\\
            (6) 2-2-2-2-2\\
            (7) 2-2-2-2-1-1\\
            (8) 2-2-2-1-1-1-1\\
            (9) 2-2-1-1-1-1-1-1\\
            (10) 2-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1\\
            (11) 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1
        }
        \wbvfill
        \wbnewpage
        \item \label{20highest1}Another way to solve a similar simpler problem is to make the total \$20 but restrict the types of bills that may be used. List all the ways to make \$20 where the highest denomination is a \$1 bill (meaning you must use at least one \$1 bill and no higher denominations).
        \par\Instr{ This should be an obvious answer that we must use twenty \$1 bills.}
        \wbvfill
        \item \label{20highest2}List all the ways to make \$20 where the highest denomination is a \$2 bill (meaning you must use at least one \$2 bill and no higher denominations).
        \par\Instr{ There are ten since you may use from 1 to 10 two-dollar bills (completed to \$20 using ones).}
        \wbvfill
        \wbvfill
        \item How do you know there are no repeats in your answers to questions \ref{20highest1} and \ref{20highest2}?
        \par\Instr{ Students may be tempted to say something like "There is only one way in \ref{20highest1} and I can see it is not in the list for \ref{20highest2}. That's not bad, but the real point is that the highest bill in the collections for \ref{20highest2} is 2, and the highest bill in the collections for \ref{20highest1} is 1. Assuming these questions are answered correctly, you know there will be no repeats before you even start. Each set has a different highest denomination. No single collection can have two separate highest denominations so no single collection can be in multiple lists.}
        \par\Instr{ It may seem strange to organize our questions this way, but we are trying to make the lists a bit smaller and also lead students into breaking up their solutions into disjoint sets. There are always many ways to organize a solution set, but it is most natural to think of organizing our bills in descending order. Also, this way is conducive to utilizing a tree diagram to list all of our solutions.} 
    \end{enumerate}
    \wbvfill
    At this point we have explored two ways to create simpler similar problems (restrict the total dollar amount and restrict the types of bills we can use), and we've seen that one simpler solution may be used to solve another (using the \$5 totals to help make the list of \$10 totals). Using one or both of these ideas, devise a plan for finding all collections of US bills that make \$20. Summarize your plan here. DO NOT carry out the plan here. Just describe a plan that you think will work.
    \wbvfill
    \wbvfill
    \wbnewpage
    \item \textbf{Carry out the plan.} Try to do what you just described to find out how many different ways there are to make \$20 using US bills. If you are struggling to make your plan work or you have determined that it just won't work, go back and revise your plan!
    \par\Instr{ One way to proceed is to make a tree diagram as below (or a table with the same information), using smaller problems already solved so not every branch needs to be shown.
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=5.5in]{images/Make20dollarsTree2.pdf}
    \end{center}
    }
    \par\Instr{ Another way to solve this problem is along the following lines.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \label{20withno10s} Determine the number of collections of bills that sum to \$20 and contain no \$20 bills or \$10 bills.
        \par
        This question is asking about the branches that do not begin with a \$10 or \$20 bill. So the first bill in each collection is below 10 and so the tree diagram will begin with three branches and proceed accordingly.
        \par The full tree diagram should look something like what is shown in Figure\ref{Making20Tree} producing $29$ total collections with no \$10 or \$20 bills. Notice there are key aspects of this tree that are worth exploring. Two key aspects mentioned above are:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Each branch has a bill denomination less than or equal to the branch it is stemming from.
            \item the branches that first use a \$5 bill must have a \$1 or another\$5 bill because of the necessity of an even number of odd denomination bills.
        \end{enumerate}
        \begin{figure}[htb]
            \begin{center}
                \includegraphics[width=5in]{images/Making20Tree.pdf}
            \end{center}
            \caption{ The entire solution tree for \$20 with no \$10 or \$20 bills}\label{Making20Tree}
        \end{figure}
        \item \label{20witha10} Determine the number of collections of bills that sum to \$20 and contain a \$10 bill.
        \par For the tree diagram organization method, this question is asking about the branch that begins with a \$10 bill. 
        \par We could create a tree diagram for this, but the existence of a \$10 bill leave us with needing a collection of ten more dollars. This was already solved in \ref{making10}. Therefore we know there are 11 collections of bills making up $20$ dollars that include a \$10 bill.
        \par Now the answers to the previous two questions can be added to the solution of using a single \$20 bill to solve the ultimate question. We get $1 + 29 + 11 = 41$ different ways to get a collection of bills that make \$20.
        \end{enumerate}
    }
    \wbvfill
    How many ways did you come up with?
    \par\Instr{ There are 41 ways. Counting the highlighted branches in the tree diagram above, there are 11 individual collections plus $10+3+6+11=30$ more for a total of 41.}
    \wbnewpage
    \item \textbf{Review the solution.}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How do you know you have not counted any collection more than once? In other words, how do you know each of your collections is different?
        \par\Instr{ As before, hopefully this will be more insightful that just saying "I checked my lists and didn't see any duplicates." It must rely on the fact that the smaller problems solved are disjoint.}
        \wbvfill
        \item How do you know you have all collections that make \$20? How do you know you have not missed any?
        \par\Instr{ This may be a tougher question to answer depending on the plan devised and carried out. But is students follow the suggestion in the exercises it may be something like "We listed all the ways to make \$20 where the highest denomination is \$1, where the highest denomination is \$2, and so on with highest \$5, \$10, and \$20. There are no other choices because using higher denominations than \$20 will give a total greater than \$20."}
        \wbvfill
    \end{enumerate}
    If you can't answer these questions or you have doubts that you have the correct answer you may need to revise your plan or how you carried it out.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\subsection{Exit Slip}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many different ways can you have \$15 in US bills? Provide a tree diagram, an organized list, or written justification for your answer.

\end{enumerate}
For the remaining two questions, your solution must include (i) the tree diagram, (ii) the answer, and (iii) a few sentences describing why you believe your tree diagram gives the correct answer (shows all the answers and no repeats).

It also could have unfolded T-B-B-B (and this is what actually happened in 2021). How many different ways could the division series have unfolded (including the two already mentioned)?

\section{Activity: Crossing the Bridge}

\Instr{  
Goals for this activity:
\begin{packedItem}
\item develop problem solving and sense making; 
\item introduction to tree diagrams; and
\item using natural logical arguments (such as quantifiable bounding, negations, case arguments, etc.).
\end{packedItem}

Especially at the beginning of the course, it is important to make sure that the students understand the constraints of the problem; so, as a class, take some time to read the question and discuss the requirements. Some students may prefer to use manipulatives to solve this problem. Different sized blocks could be used to represent each person, and you also may want a small block for the flashlight. 

You may want to have the students act out their solutions. If so, it helps if each person holds a sign indicating their weight so that the rest of the class can check to see that each movement is ``legal.'' You could even ask one of the groups secretly to make a mistake on purpose to see if the other students were paying attention. }

%<*logicProblems:crossBridge:intro2>
\indent {\bf A}lfred, {\bf B}ruce, {\bf C}athy, and {\bf D}oug were coming back to their village in the middle of the night. The tiny bridge to the town is too small for more than $2$ people to cross it at the same time, and it is only safe to cross if someone is holding a flashlight. Since they only brought one flashlight, someone will have to return with the flashlight before two more people can cross. Doug can walk across the bridge in $10$ minutes, Cathy takes $5$ minutes to cross, Bruce can skip across in $2$ minutes, and Alfred can cross the bridge in $1$ minute. Unfortunately, when you walk across the bridge with someone else, you can only cross the bridge at the speed of the slower person. What is the least amount of time needed to get everyone across the bridge?
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Understand the Problem:} Act out the situation. Members of your group will play the roles of Alfred, Bruce, Cathy, and Doug. If you are a group of 3, you will only be able to play Alfred, Bruce, and Cathy. Use a prop for the flashlight and define a physical space in the classroom that will stand in as the bridge. Play act until you have successfully gotten everyone across the bridge. Are the rules clear?
\item \textbf{Devise a plan:} Solve a simpler problem first. Imagine Doug is ill and therefore not with the group. What is the quickest way for Alfred, Bruce, and Cathy to get across the bridge?
\par\Instr{ 8 minutes. The most efficient way for the three to cross is to have Alfred escort Bruce and Cathy one at a time across the bridge. The two trips take 2 minutes and 5 minutes (with Alfred being held back to the slower speed each time. After delivering one of them Alfred has to make the trip back to retrieve the other. This trip takes 1 minute as Alfred is on his own. The total time for the three trips is 8 minutes.}
\wbvfill
\item How do you know this is the quickest way? Construct a tree diagram of all the ways they can cross the bridge without any obvious waste of time (repeating a position---going from one position to another and then back to the position you were before---is an obvious waste of time).
\par\Instr{ Two ways of the six total are optimal.
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{images/Bridge-ABC.pdf}
    \end{center}
}
\wbvfill\wbvfill
\item For each way of crossing the bridge, calculate the total time. What is the least? How can it be done? Are there more ways than one?
\wbvfill\wbnewpage
\item\label{19min} \textbf{Carry out the plan.} Now return to the original problem and use the same process as you used for the simpler problem. What is the least amount of time needed to get everyone across the bridge? How can it be done?
%</logicProblems:crossBridge:intro2>

\Instr{ The most common answer for this problem is to make Alfred cross with each person and come back with the torch each time. In this way it will take $10$ minutes for Doug to cross with Alfred and $1$ minute for Alfred to return with the torch. Then it will take $5$ minutes for Cathy to get across the bridge with Alfred and $1$ minute for Alfred to return again. Finally, it takes $2$ minutes for Bruce to get across with Alfred. By adding all the times together it will take a total of $10+1+5+1+2=19$ minutes.

There is a quicker way. The students may discover it while they try to justify their claim that $19$ minutes is the fastest time in Question~{\normalfont\ref{quicker}}. If they get stuck, ask them, 

\begin{minipage}[H]{5.75in}
\tt \em
\begin{center}
{``Is there a way you can hide Cathy?'' }
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

Some students may try to send Doug and Cathy across first after asking the above question. This is fine and they should quickly discover that this is not the fastest method. 

This will hopefully get them to realize that if you have Doug and Cathy walk over together, you do not have to make Cathy walk over with someone faster than her. They will also notice that this can not be the first people across if we are looking for a faster time. The first people to go over the bridge would be Alfred and Bruce and then have Bruce come back which will take $4$ minutes round trip. Next, Doug and Cathy walk across together which will take $10$ minutes. Now Alfred will head back with the torch which will add another minute. Finally, Alfred and Bruce will walk across the bridge in $2$ minutes. Adding all the times together the total time is $2+2+10+1+2=17$ minutes. This is the fastest possible time.}

\wbvfill
%<*logicProblems:crossBridge:quicker>
\item\label{quicker} \textbf{Review.} Why is there no quicker way to get everyone across? Thoroughly explain your answer.
%</logicProblems:crossBridge:quicker>

\Instr{  %
To answer this, you need a systematic way to list all possibilities. It is possible that the students reach this question believing that $19$ minutes is the least amount of time to get everyone across. So it is important to spend some time exhausting other possibilities until they discover the $17$ minute version shown above.

Convincing themselves that $17$ minutes is the least amount of time possible may be a difficult task, but many observations can be made such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item There must be at least $5$ trips made across the bridge.
\item Each person must go across at least once. (So for example, since Doug must cross at some time, more than $10$ minutes will be needed.)
\item If Cathy and Doug travel together first then one of them must return with the flashlight.
\end{itemize}
We can make some obvious bounds from a number of these observations, but using a tree diagram\index{tree diagram} is a good way to exhaust all possibilities. Tree diagrams will be discussed later in greater detail and are an important tool to use in systematic counting scenarios. 

Each tree begins with a ``Start'' position,  from which six edges are drawn, each representing one of the pairs of people crossing the bridge (see Figure~{\normalfont\ref{startTree}}, where AB means that Alfred and Bruce crossed the bridge). 
Then for each such pair, an edge is drawn to represent who is returning across the bridge with the flashlight as in Figure~{\normalfont\ref{returnTree}}.
Continuing this process for the top branch yields Figure~{\normalfont\ref{alfredBruce}}.
Developing this top branch in class, then assigning at least one of the remaining five branches for homework may be appropriate.

Students may want to keep a running total of the time taken along each branch as they construct the tree (see Figure~{\normalfont\ref{returnTree}}), or they may prefer to label each edge with the time. Then, if ever a branch reaches more than $17$ minutes (or whatever lowest total they have identified so far), they need not complete this branch since it cannot produce a faster time (this is called pruning the tree).

\item\label{4minBruce} It turns out that Bruce stubbed his toe on the way to the bridge and will actually take $4$ minutes to cross the bridge. Now how long would it take for everyone to get across the bridge?
%</logicProblems:crossBridge:4minBruce>

\Instr{ If we use the optimal method discussed in Question~{\normalfont\ref{19min}} we find that it takes $23$ minutes for the party to cross the bridge. It is easy to see that we must replace each $2$ in the calculation of Question~{\normalfont\ref{19min}} with a $4$, and since Bruce crossed the bridge $3$ times this adds $6$ minutes to the total time. However, if we use the first method discussed where Alfred went across all five times and escorted each team member we notice Bruce only crossed the bridge once. Therefore we only need to add $2$ minutes to the total time in this method producing a total time of $21$ minutes. 

These two problems are carefully chosen to point out that just because a technique works well in one setting does not mean it is always going to be the best method to use.}

\Instr{  Again we suggest using a tree diagram\index{tree diagram} to exhaust all possible methods to show which method is optimal.

\item \textbf{Project Question:} How many different ways can you make \$50 in US bills? Provide a tree diagram to support your claim and write a statement about how you used results from the \$20 class activity to find your answer.
\par\Instr{ The problem using coins to make a dollar is widely known, and I can find an answer for making \$50 with change but that number is extremely high because of the use of coins. We are asking for much less and the answer doesn't seem to be immediately available on the net.

\item You need to cross a river in a small rowboat and take your possessions with you.  The boat is only big enough for you and one possession at a time.  Unfortunately, some of your belongings can't be left alone on the river bank while you transport the other.  Your belongings are: a wolf, a goat, and a big bag of cabbage.   Problems: the wolf will eat the goat and the goat will eat the cabbages if they are able to do so.  How do you get everything across?

\section{Additional Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item You're at a meeting where there is a make-your-own-sandwich platter. There is only one kind of bread, but there is a choice of what to put on it. There are three different lunch meats, two different cheeses, and extras—mustard, mayonnaise, and lettuce—to choose from. How many sandwiches can you make using one lunch meat, one cheese and any combination of extras?
    \par\Instr{ Though this question can be answered using the multiplication principle, as in $3\times 2\times 2\times 2\times 2=48$, it is expected students will create a tree diagram. You may wish to use this exercise in class to give students an example of a tree diagram not associated with counting money.}
    \item How many different ways can you have \$30 in US bills? Make sure to utilize the techniques and strategies you have learned above and pay close attention to work from above that you may be able to re-use.
    \par\Instr{ One may initially think that you can multiply the number of ways ot make \$10 by the number of ways to make \$20. However that drastically over counts the possibilities because the tree diagram resulting from this method would not produce unique branches.
    \par
    So without some advance counting techniques we will need to use an exhaustive counting method. However we will utilize some information we already have produced above.
    \par
    We will partition the solution set into those that have a \$20 bill and those that do not. For those that do have a \$20 bill, we know that we need ten more dollars and so the \$20 bill with all the solutions from question \ref{making10} will produce all 11 of the collections of bills containing a \$20 bill that add to \$30. 
    \par
    The harder part is to find the collection of bills that do not contain a \$20 bill. There are many ways to do this, but we would suggest partitioning this work into those that contain a \$10 bill and those that do not. For those that do, we know there is a \$10 bill so there are \$20 left to account for. Without using a \$20 bill there are 40 ways to make \$20, as we have seen. It is only left to find how many ways there are to make \$30 using only fives, twos, and ones. Making a tree diagram for these collections reveals 58 possibilities.
    \par
    Finally we would add all the possibilities from above to get $11+40+58 = 109$ total collections of U.S. bills that make \$30.}
